Decomposition and generalisation are related. 
Whereas decomposition involves breaking the problem down into smaller parts,  generalisation involves combining those smaller parts. 
These actions are not the inverse of one another; when you generalise the individual parts, 
youâ€™re not putting the problem together again in the same way as before.

The point of generalisation is to look at the decomposed parts and find ways to make
the solution easier to handle and more widely applicable to similar problems. In the
example above, instead of having numerous parts which can each draw only one type
of eye, there is one generic part that can draw many different types of eye.

Research Design:
A structured framework that guides the collection and analysis of data.
Typically qualitative, quantitative, or mixed-methods, depending on the study's objectives.

Population and Sampling:
Description of the target population.
Sampling techniques (e.g., random sampling, purposive sampling).
Sample size justification.

Data Collection Methods:
Instruments used (e.g., questionnaires, interviews, observation).
Procedures for administering tools.
Ethical considerations and approvals obtained.

Data Analysis Techniques:
Qualitative data: thematic analysis, coding procedures.
Quantitative data: statistical methods, software tools (e.g., SPSS, Excel).

Validity and Reliability:
Steps taken to ensure accuracy and consistency of data.
Pilot studies and expert validation may be discussed.

Limitations of the Study:
Constraints in design, sampling, or tools that may affect results.
