Computational thinking is an approach to problem-solving that involves using a set of
practices and principles from computer science to formulate a solution that’s executable by a computer. It’s not just for programmers. In fact, it’s applicable in a diverse
array of fields.

Computational Thinking is a problem-solving approach that involves breaking down complex issues into manageable parts, identifying patterns, focusing on relevant information, and developing step-by-step solutions.

Core Concepts of Computational Thinking:

Decomposition: Breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable tasks.

Pattern Recognition: Identifying similarities and trends within data or problems.

Abstraction: Focusing on the essential details while ignoring irrelevant information.

Algorithm Design: Developing a step-by-step solution or set of rules to solve the problem.
