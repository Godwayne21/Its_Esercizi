Logic and systematic reasoning are key underpinnings of CT because computer programs are essentially an automation of our reasoning processes.
Therefore, writing solutions requires a good understanding of logic and the ability to use proper notation over natural language. 
This chapter has covered the basics of inductive and deductive reasoning, 
as well as the importance of Boolean and symbolic forms of logic to computing.

Logic is an essential part of algorithms, which are the among the bedrock of computing. 
They are the core of any program and thus play a part in every computer-based solution. 
This chapter introduced the basic building blocks of every algorithm and the notion of state.

It’s important in the case of both logic and algorithms to respect the need for a systematic approach. 
Although both can make intuitive sense on some level, it’s also easy to make mistakes when considering them that way. 
The use of correct logical notation will help you to avoid making common mistakes.

What is an Algorithm?
A precise, step-by-step set of instructions with a clear start and end, used to solve problems or perform tasks.

Difference from Logic:
Logic helps determine truth; algorithms use logic to perform actions in a structured way.

Core Properties of Algorithms:
Sequence: Steps must happen in a specific order.

Iteration: Repeating steps using loops.

Selection: Making decisions using conditions (if, else).

State: The current values of variables that track progress.

Variables:
Store and update data during execution (e.g., scores, counters).

Controlling Execution:
Loops (Iteration): Repeat until a condition is false.

Conditionals (Selection): Execute actions only when conditions are met.

Common Mistakes ("Gotchas"):
Ambiguity: Computers need precise, clear instructions.

Misuse of logic operators (and, or, not).

Forgetting to handle all possible conditions (e.g., using if without else).

Ignoring logical precedence rules—use parentheses to clarify.

Best Practices:
Always be explicit.

Use correct logical symbols.

Avoid relying on common sense—computers don’t have it.
