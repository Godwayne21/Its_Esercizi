Bugs are mistakes that can cause errors in your solution. 
Numerous techniques exist either to prevent bugs making it into your solution or to deal with them after theyâ€™ve made their way in.

Preventing bugs from getting into your solution means careful design effort. 
The earlier bugs are found, the cheaper they are to repair.

Mitigating errors means anticipating and controlling their potential consequences.
Programming defensively is a great way to prevent bugs causing havoc.

Hunting for bugs and removing them is done by testing and debugging. Testing lets you
search for bugs and both top-down and bottom-up strategies offer systematic ways to
approach testing. Debugging using logs or tracing helps you track down the ultimate cause of errors.

1. Overview
This chapter discusses how the collected data was processed and analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative methods. It outlines procedures followed from data collection to interpretation, focusing on survey data and thematic analysis from interviews.

2. Data Preparation
The data was cleaned and verified for completeness.
Coding was used for qualitative responses.
Quantitative data were entered into statistical software (e.g., SPSS).

3. Descriptive Statistics
Demographic details of respondents were presented (age, gender, role, experience).
Frequency distributions and percentages were used to describe responses.

4. Thematic Analysis (Qualitative)
Open-ended interview responses were categorized into key themes.
Themes reflect attitudes, experiences, and insights related to the research problem.
NVivo or similar software might have been used for coding (though not explicitly stated).

5. Quantitative Analysis
Survey data were analyzed using statistical techniques (mean, standard deviation, etc.).
Results were presented in tables and charts for clarity.
Comparisons and interpretations were made based on the statistical output.

6. Key Findings
The analysis revealed trends and patterns relevant to the research objectives.
Respondents showed varying levels of agreement or concern depending on their background and experience.
Qualitative data supported and contextualized the quantitative findings.

7. Conclusion
The chapter laid the groundwork for the next one, which would interpret these results in light of existing literature and theoretical frameworks.
