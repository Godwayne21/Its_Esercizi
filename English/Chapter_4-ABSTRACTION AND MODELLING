This chapter introduced abstraction as a key driver behind helping to understand
solutions and make them more powerful. By picking out only the relevant details and
suppressing the remainder, you can represent only what it is essential to a problem,
leaving you free to concentrate on solving the essence of the problem. By using layers of
abstraction, you can consider a problem from multiple points of view, while still benefitting from a reduction of mental load.

Modelling, a type of abstraction, plays an important part in problem-solving by representing the key parts of a solution. 
This helps you to understand the system you’re trying to build, as well as predict its eventual behaviour. 
Models come in numerous forms, which you can freely choose from.

1. Introduction
Hypothesis testing is used to make decisions about population parameters based on sample data.
Two types of hypotheses:
Null Hypothesis (H₀): Assumes no effect or no difference.
Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Indicates the presence of an effect or difference.

2. Types of Hypothesis Tests
One-tailed test: Tests for deviation in one direction (e.g., H₁: μ > μ₀).
Two-tailed test: Tests for deviation in both directions (e.g., H₁: μ ≠ μ₀).

3. Errors in Hypothesis Testing
Type I Error (α): Rejecting H₀ when it is true.
Type II Error (β): Failing to reject H₀ when it is false.
Power of a test: Probability of correctly rejecting a false H₀, i.e., 1 - β.

4. Critical Region and Level of Significance
Critical region: The range of values where H₀ is rejected.
Level of significance (α): The maximum probability of making a Type I error (commonly 0.05 or 0.01).

5. Procedure of Hypothesis Testing
State H₀ and H₁.
Choose the significance level α.
Determine the test statistic.
Define the critical region.
Compute the test statistic from sample data.
Make a decision (reject or fail to reject H₀).

6. Large Sample Tests
Z-tests are used when sample size > 30:
Test for population mean.
Test for difference between two means.
Test for proportions and difference of proportions.

7. Small Sample Tests
t-tests are used when sample size ≤ 30:
Single mean test.
Two means (independent and paired samples).
Chi-square tests:
Test for independence.
Test for goodness of fit.

8. Examples and Exercises
The chapter includes worked-out examples and exercises to practice applying the hypothesis testing procedures using Z, t, and χ² statistics.
